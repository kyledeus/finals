            <a style="font-size: small;">Let me take you on a little journey into my life. In the days of yore, I was a basketball maestro, effortlessly sinking three-pointers, and known for my cheerful and approachable nature. Life was a breeze, and I had this 'que sera, sera' attitude â€“ whatever will be, will be.<a><br>
            <br>
            <a style="font-size: small;">But then, the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic stormed into our world like an uninvited guest at a party. Suddenly, everyone found themselves trapped in their homes, playing the hide-and-seek game with the virus. As for me, I was trying to attend online classes, but the internet connection was more capricious than the weather. Learning was as impossible as trying to squeeze water from a stone, so I took a break.<a><br>
            <br>
            <a style="font-size: small;">I didn't know how long this hiatus would last, but remember, my motto was 'whatever happens, happens.' I didn't dwell on the future's what-ifs.<a><br>
            <br>
            <a style="font-size: small;">Fast forward a year into the pandemic, and life had become a never-ending cycle of sameness. Boredom became my constant companion, and I couldn't help but wonder, 'Is this how it's going to be forever?' The future loomed in my thoughts like a dark cloud.<a><br>

            <br>
            <a style="font-size: small;">But here we are, in the present, and life has regained its thrilling pace. The stress and occasional bouts of nausea remind me that I might stumble, but the thrill of the journey keeps me going. I have new friends who refuse to be stuck in one place, and together, we're racing toward the future. Most importantly, I'm here, alive, and thriving.<a><br>
